### Bio

Hey, I'm Emma! I'm a 19-year-old programmer and content creator who loves diving into history and building cool stuff in the gaming world. My pronouns are She/They, and I enjoy working with languages like C# and Java.

On Discord, you might have seen me jokingly claim to have violated the Geneva Conventions thrice and other playful remarks. But let's be clear, my content and views don't align with that! I'm all about creating inclusive and entertaining content.

Over on YouTube, I create engaging videos on various topics, with a special focus on Minecraft and other exciting games. I've been part of "Das Kollektiv," a dynamic team with Bjarne and ShieloTV presenting a variety of interesting and entertaining content on our channel. My expertise lies in Minecraft, where I impress with my modifications and programming skills in C# and Java.

Working alongside me is the talented designer ShieloTV/AlbernLYRY, who ensures a visually appealing experience for our content.

Apart from gaming, I have a passion for history and programming, always working on interesting projects, including game mods and coding challenges.

I'm thrilled to collaborate with fellow developers and content creators, so feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you'd like to chat or work together on something cool!

Let's connect and create amazing things together!
